# Genealogy
The prevalence of digital pictures, especially from smart phones, has increased the number of images and videos of people. At the same time, the abundance of storage space tends to have people not delete pictures or videos that they take. Consequently, finding images and videos increases in difficulty. Genealogy (the study and tracing of lines of descendants) is well-established for tracing and tracking family relations, but doesnâ€™t have good ties into the richer sets of pictures that exist today or to archived pictures that are now being digitized. Ideally, when a genealogist asks about the great grandmother of person X, they would like to get the set of pictures for the individual as well as their name. This project will create a system that links family tree information with an archive of pictures and the metadata of the pictures
